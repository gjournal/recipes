Brian's Pushcart Sausage and Peppers

Adapted From: Slow Cooker: THE BEST COOKBOOK EVER | page 279

Note: See tips.  This is a recipie you should adapt to your needs.

Yield:  scale as needed

Dry Ingredients:

1 tbsp light brown sugar 
1 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

Wet Ingredients:

2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsp tomato paste

Fresh Ingredients:

1-2 Medium Onion, white or yellow
1-3 Bell peppers, assorted colors
1 pack Johnsonville Italian Sausage, Sweet, Mild or Hot.


Optional:

Process:

Mix all wet and dry ingredients in the insert of your Crockpot.

Chop Peppers and Onion into 3/8 - 1/2 in strips, and add to Crockpot.

Mix everything in the Crockpot to get the peppers/onions well coated with the wet/dry ingredients.

Add Sausages as a single layer on the top of the pepper/onion mix. 

Cook on high for five hours.  When the sausage temps 165,  you can reduce heat and serve when ready.


Tips:

Add more or less Peppers and Onion based on your preference.  I usually use one onion and two peppers, but will often add a third pepper just to get a third color.  This is a beautiful dish with three different color peppers.

Avoid letting the sausages touch the sides of the Crockpot so they dont burn where they touch.

If you don't have a Crockpot, buy a manual one. A Crockpot with fancy electronics will ruin diner if the power goes out in the middle of a cook, because the damb things wont turn themselves back on.  Dinner is ruined, along with your mood.

You can scale this recipe up or down as needed.  The original recipe from the book called for five onions, six peppers, and 3lb of sausage. I've never owned a Crockpot big enough to hold that much stuff.
