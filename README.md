# recipies

These are my favorite recipies.  Some are old family recipies,  some are used every week, and some are just recipies I never want to loose.

# The Fussy Hen

Stated Goals of the page:

Most cooking pages are designed to waste as much of your time as possible for profit.  This page is designed to waste as little of it as possible.  This page might never turn a profit, and that's ok.  Its primary purpose is to act as a repository of my favorite recipes for my own kitchen.  It is shared in the hopes that it will be useful to you.

There will never be advertisements on this page for products or services, with the following exceptions:
   I *may* provide affiliate links to products and services that I use myself. They will not be imbedded in the recipies, but will be in their own section of the pages
   I *may* accept donations if you wish to support my efforts here.  They are always appreciated, but never expected.  This page is not designed for profit, but I wont complain if it supports itself.  If the page becomes popular enough that hosting fees begin to increase, this may become more necessary in order to avoid marketing noise that makes me hate other recipe sites.


Page Design Document:

- NO advertisements
- NO third party tracking
- TESTED on Chromebook
- Affliate links are not embedded in articles
- Atrribution
- No life story in recipes

If there is a story to be had, it will be after the recipie, never before!
