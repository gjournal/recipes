=== Making the Meatloaf ===

1:  Add the Breadcrumbs and Milk to a bowl.  Optionally, you can add all of the soak ingredients and while you wait,  or you can add the rest of the Soak ingredients when you add the '''Last In''' ingredients.  

2:  Wait  5-10 minutes to let the breadcrumbs soak up all of the milk.  

3:  Add all remaining '''Meatloaf''' ingredients (NOT Jennys Glaze) to the bowl and work with your hands until everything is incorporated.  Don't work it any more than necessary.

4:    Divide into four 1 lb loaves,  or eight 1/2 lb loaves.  Loaves need to be flat with consistent thickness.  Place in smoker with temp probes, and smoke to 155.

5:    Increase temp to 300

6:    Combine all Jenny's Glaze ingredients.  Mix well.  Brush on the loaves.

7:    Continue to smoke until 165.
